# Intex_Grind

## This is the website for the Turtle Shell Project. The main aim of this site is to allow volunteers, organizations, and admins to manage events.


*Volunteers* can come to the website and submit their information to be contacted by an admin for volunteer opportunities.
*Organizations* and individuals can come to the site to request an event and will be contacted by the admin.
*Admins* can login and see or edit dashboard overviews, volunteers, and event information.

## Page Overview

### Home Page (Anonymous User)

This is the main landing page for non-authenticated anonymous users. This page has tabs at the top that allow the user to learn more about the organization, how they can help, and sign up to be volunteers.

### Login Page 

This is a simple login page for admins to authenticate and gain access to organization data and events.

**Admin login** 
In order to login as an admin and see this page, use the following credentials:

*USERNAME: jsmith
PASSWORD: password123*

### Home Page (Admin)

This home page is set to be a different color than the non-authenticated page so the admin knows they are logged in. The landing page after login is the dashboard. This allows the admin to see organization data about previous events, event status, and insights on what the organization is doing well or needs to improve.
